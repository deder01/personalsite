# Finally, my own website!
As a developer, does it really make sense for me to not have a personally site?  No.  So I'm finally doing that.
Also going to refresh my django on the way hopefully.


# But what is on here
That is yet TBD.  Gotta get things up and running with django/heroku, then we'll focus on content ;)
